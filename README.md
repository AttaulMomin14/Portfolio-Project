# Portfolio-Project
Adventure Works Power BI Dashboard

In this project I created a fully interactive and insightful dashboard for a bike selling company, which the management used to take data driven decisions.

I was given folder of raw csv files, which contained information about transactions, returns, products, customers and sales territories.

I used Power BI to
- Connect and transform the raw data.
- Build a relational data model.
- Create calculated columns and measures with DAX.
- Design an interactive dashboard to visualize data.
